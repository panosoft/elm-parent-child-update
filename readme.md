# Helper functions for Stateless Child Components in Elm

> Micro-library to reduce boilerplate code for implementing Parent/Child communication in stateless components.

## What does this do and why do it?

#### Aren't components bad?
The prevailing belief that `components are bad and functions are good` is mainly because of semantics. When people use the word `component`, many times it conjurs up `Objects` with `Internal State`. So, the Elm community has avoided this term and instead talks about factoring out functions.

That approach works but only to a point. Anytime a Child Component's API is Asynchronous then things become more complicated.

#### Asynchronous APIs
After a Child's Asynchronous API call is complete and it must return information back to its Parent then the simplest approach is to do so through a Parent Mesage so that the Parent can update its model.

#### Child models
When an Asynchronous API call involves MULTIPLE messages back to the Child Component, then the Child must also maintain state and therefore requires its own independent model (that it defines).

Also, when the Child Component maintains state across multiple API calls, it also needs its own model.

#### This library in a nutshell
This library supports both mechanisms, i.e. returning messages back to the Parent and passing Child models to Child update functions.

## Parent/Child Communication

If the App contains components, then those components are considered `Child` components of the App. Any component can have `Child` components and are considered `Parent` components to their children.

All components rely on their Parent to pass in state and messages into their `update` function. In the case of the App, the Elm Runtime can be thought of as the App's Parent.

At the App level, `update` returns a new `Model` and a `Cmd`. But at lower-levels, a Child component need a mechanism for communicating with their Parent. Therefore, there are 2 different signatures for `update`:

```elm
-- App's update
update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )

-- Child component's update
update : Config msg -> Msg -> Model -> ( ( Model, Cmd Msg ), List msg)
```
For Child components there is an optional configuration parameter. This configuration contains the Parent's message taggers for creating messages that will be sent back to the Parent via the additional return parameter, which is a `List` of Parent messages. (This same configuration parameter can also be passed to the Child's `subscriptions` function.)

When a Parent gets a message destined for one of its children, it will call the Child's `update` function, which will return a new Child Model, a Command to be run and a List of Parent messages.

The Parent will then take these messages and recursively call its `update` function mutating its model through each iteration.

This code is complex and quickly becomes boilerplate. This library hopes to greatly reduce both.


## API

Imagine the following scenario:

<p align="center"><img src="images/Parent Child Components.png"></p>

Here the `App` has a `Child` component which in turn has a child labeled `Grandchild`.

Since the App's `update` function has a different signature than the Child or Grandchild's `update`, there needs to be 2 different API functions.


### App Children
The first is for the App children:

```elm
updateChildApp : ChildUpdate childMsg childModel appMsg -> AppUpdate appMsg appModel -> ChildModelAccessor appModel childModel -> ChildTagger childMsg appMsg -> ReplaceChildModel appModel childModel -> childMsg -> appModel -> ( appModel, Cmd appMsg )
updateChildApp childUpdate appUpdate childModelAccessor childTagger replaceChildModel childMsg appModel
```

In our example scenario, this function updates `Child` THEN `App`, hence the name `updateChildApp`. In detail, the `Child`'s `update` function is called. Then the `App`'s model is mutated to include the new `Child` model. And finally, the `App`'s update function is called recursively with each message that was returned in the `List` of messages returned from the `Child`'s update. Since the `App`'s `update` mutates the model, that mutated model is passed to subsequent calls to `update`.


### Non-App Children
The second API function is for non-App children:

```elm
updateChildParent : ChildUpdate childMsg childModel parentMsg -> ParentUpdate parentMsg parentModel grandParentMsg -> ChildModelAccessor parentModel childModel -> ChildTagger childMsg parentMsg -> ReplaceChildModel parentModel childModel -> childMsg -> parentModel -> ( ( parentModel, Cmd parentMsg ), List grandParentMsg )
updateChildParent childUpdate parentUpdate childModelAccessor childTagger replaceChildModel childMsg appModel
```

In our example scenario, this function updates the `Grandchild` THEN the `Child`, hence the name `updateChildParent`.


## Usage

### Steps to implement a Child Component

To implement a Child Component using this library, there are 7 modifications to an App (or Parent Component) that must be made:

	1. Import the ParentChildUpdate module from this library
	2. Import Child module
	3. Add Child Model to App (or Parent) Model
	4. Add Child Message to App (or Parent) Msg type
	5. Handle Child Message in update function
	6. Create a function using this libary to update Child and App (or Parent)
	7. Handle any Child subscriptions

The easiest way to understand the API is to see an example of how it's used.

### App code
Here's the salient code in the App:

```elm
module App exposing (..)

import ParentChildUpdate exposing (..)
import Child exposing (..)


type alias Model =
    { childModel : Child.Model
    }

init : ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init =
	{ childModel = Child.initModel } ! []


childConfig : Child.Config
childConfig =
	{ onEvent1 = AppMsg1 }


type Msg
    = Nop
    | AppMsg1
    | AppMsg2
    | ChildModule Child.Msg

update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
update msg model =
	let
		updateChild : Child.Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
		updateChild =
		    ParentChildUpdate.updateChildApp (Child.update childConfig) update .childModel ChildModule (\model childModel -> { model | childModel = childModel })
	in
	    case msg of
	        Nop ->
	            model ! []
	        AppMsg1 ->
	            model ! []
	        AppMsg2 ->
	            model ! []
			ChildModule childMsg ->
				updateChild childMsg model

subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
subscriptions model =
    Sub.map ChildModule <| Child.subscriptions childConfig model.childModel

```
N.B. that `updateChild` uses the API function `updateChildApp`. That's because we're at the App level and the App and its children have different `update` function signatures.

Here, the App's model contains the Child's model.

The App tags (or wraps) messages destined for the Child component with the function `ChildModule`.

The lambda function mutates the App's model to replace the Child's model.

The Child's configuration is passed to its `subscriptions` function.


### Child code
Here's the salient code in the Child:

```elm
module Child exposing (..)

import ParentChildUpdate exposing (..)
import Grandchild exposing (..)


type alias Model =
    { grandchildModel : Grandchild.Model
    }


type alias Config msg =
	{ onEvent1 : msg
	}


initModel : Model
initModel =
	{ grandchildModel = Grandchild.initModel }


grandchildConfig : Grandchild.Config
grandchildConfig =
	{ onEvent1 = ChildMsg1, onEvent2 = ChildMsg2 }


type Msg
    = Nop
    | ChildMsg1
    | ChildMsg2
    | GrandchildModule Grandchild.Msg


update : Config msg -> Msg -> Model -> ( ( Model, Cmd Msg ), List msg )
update config msg model =
	let
		updateGrandchild : Grandchild.Msg -> Model -> ( ( Model, Cmd Msg ), List msg )
		updateGrandchild =
		    ParentChildUpdate.updateChildParent (Grandchild.update grandchildConfig) (update config) .grandchildModel GrandchildModule (\model grandchildModel -> { model | grandchildModel = grandchildModel })
	in
	    case msg of
	        Nop ->
	            (model ! [], [])
	        ChildMsg1 ->
	            (model ! [], [])
	        ChildMsg2 ->
	            (model ! [], [])
			GrandchildModule grandchildMsg ->
				updateGrandChild grandchildMsg model


subscriptions : Config msg -> Model -> Sub Msg
subscriptions config model =
    Sub.map GrandchildModule <| Grandchild.subscriptions grandchildConfig model.grandchildModel

```
N.B. that `updateGrandchild` uses the API function `updateChildParent`. That's because we're NOT at the App level and we and our children have similar `update` function signatures.

Here, the Child's model contains the Grandchild's model.

The Child tags messages destined for the Grandchild component with the function `GrandchildModule`.

The lambda function mutates the Child's model to replace the Grandchild's model.

The Child's configuration is passed to its `subscriptions` function.

**The only difference between the `App` code and the `Child` code above is which API function from this library is used.**

### Additional Descendants
The `Grandchild` component can also have children and so on. The code for all subsequent descendants is identical to the code in the `Child` above since the only special case is at the top-level, i.e. the App level.
